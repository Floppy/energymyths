						The Mail published a story on Wind Turbine Syndrome, claiming that 'thousands' of people are falling sick near wind farms.
            Shown is the original picture used for the story, which appears to be a wind farm in Mordor.
            Astute observers may notice that the wind turbines shown appear to be mirror images of each other, and that the one on the right
            is sort of floating in the air.
            Anyway, the Mail's photoshop department notwithstanding...

					<aside class="notes">
						A paper by Carl Phillips in the Bulletin of Science, Technology and Society.
            The paper contains no numbers or analysis, and mainly seems to be an argument that we should take seriously the many 
            self-reported 'adverse event reports', and that this adds up to 'overwhelming evidence that 
            wind turbines cause serious health problems'.
            The only mentions of "wind turbine syndrome" are in this paper, and on a *lot* of anti-turbine websites.
            Carl Phillips seems to spend most of his time working on 'Tobacco Harm Reduction'.

					<aside class="notes">
            To compare, 50 to 100 million are killed by vehicles, 100 million to 1 billion a year killed by hitting buildings. 
            The big killer though are the cats, with estimates ranging from 200 million to 3 and a half billion.
            Each turbine kills an average of 4.27 birds a year.
            Even with an 10-fold expansion of wind power, it would still be less dangerous to birds than cellphone towers are.
            The RSPB estimates that cats kill 55 million birds a year in the UK - even with a million turbines in the UK, 
            this figure would be nowhere near.

					<h1>#4: Nuclear power is dangerous!</h1>
					<aside class="notes">
						Nuclear power scares people, and the debate around it can get pretty silly, with people losing a grip on basic facts. 
            Fortunately, there's plenty of science that's been done, and there are plenty of ways we can look at this. 
            First, which would you rather live next to, a nuclear plant or a coal plant?

					<aside class="notes">
            Nuclear plants may release a small amount of radioactivity into the environment during their normal operations.
            Coal plants don't run on anything radioactive though, so surely they can't! Coal, however, contains Uranium, Thorium, 
            and all sorts of other things. These don't burnm very well, so they end up concentrated in the ash. Research in the US indicates
            the following:
						Nuclear plants: 4.8 person-rem/year
            Nuclear full fuel lifecycle: 136
            Coal: 490
            At best, coal ends up releasing 3.6 times more radiation into the environment than nuclear, but we don't worry about that.

					<aside class="notes">
						This graphic from XKCD is endlessly fascinating here. You get the same radioation from eating a banana as you do from 
            living within 50 miles of a nuclear plant for a year, which is 10% of the normal background dose for a day.
            The extra dose in Tokyo following Fukushima was 40 micro sieverts, the same as a single flight from New York to LA.

          </small></p>
					<aside class="notes">
						Another really interesting way of looking at the safety of power is by looking at the number of deaths for 
            the amount of energy produced. This is a logarithmic graph; otherwise you wouldn't see the bottom end at all.
            Here we can see that globally, coal is the worst killer, mainly through the effects of particulates. Number at the top
            is global, at 170k. China pushed this average up - their stat is 280k, but in the US it's only 15k. Biomass is really high,
            with many people being killed by smoke effects in the developing world.
            Nuclear is nowhere to be seen among the big killers; in fact, it's the lowest, even taking the worst-case figures for accidents
            like Chernobyl.
            Even wind is higher than nuclear, because sometimes an engineer falls off a turbine during maintenance.

						Low level is precautionary, and contains at most small amounts of short-lived radiation. This is not a problem, 
            and is often incinerated.
            Intermediate is a bit nastier, with shielding required in some cases, but it's only the high-level waste that's really 
            radioactive, and takes about 1000 years to reach the same level as natural Uranium ore.

            Anyone spot the obvious mistake here?
						Anti-scientific bullshit does not help anyone, from either side.
            The fact is that there are plenty of reasons to be wary of relying on a new generation of nuclear power in this country,
            ranging from the long lead time, a shortage of industrial capacity, and the even supply of Uranium, but safety is 
            really not one of them. This sort of thinking even gets applied to new nuclear designs, such as Thorium reactors, which are
            even safer than the last generation.
