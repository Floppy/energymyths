Energy: Facts & Fiction
=======================

A short talk delivered at Horsham Skeptics in the Pub on Feb 11, 2013.

The talk itself is open source, released under the MIT license, so you can basically do what you want with it. See LICENSE.md
for the full details.

Some images are obviously owned by the copyright holders, such as the newspaper front pages. I'm unclear on the proper 
licensing of these, but attribution is included for all content from other sources.

Technical Details
-----------------

The code uses the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) framework. This is included as a submodule, so 
you need to do the following commands in order to edit:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
